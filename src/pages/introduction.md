# WELCOME TO FTC!

## What is this?
FTC requires lots of learning to get started. This is a guide to help you get started and a reference for FTC information.

## What is FTC?
FTC stands for ***F**irst* **T**ech **C**hallenge. It is a nationwide robotics tournament that is held annually by the non-profit, *First*, with the help of volunteers. The goal of FTC is to promote the development of young individuals in the field of robotics. For more information about FTC, visit [First's website](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc).

<!-- ### Want to join FTC?

### FTC vs FRC
While FTC teams typically are composed of 10-15 members, our FRC team has member counts of up to 70. There is only one FRC team and as a result of there being one larger robot, work is divided mostly by part of robot (intake, shooter, etc.). In FTC we divide work mostly by category (software, hardware, etc.). There is no *"better"* robotics competition; which competition you choose should be based on your personal preferences. 

## FTC Competitions

### Advancement
![event-advancement](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91638482/187924536-cacd9397-1d87-4f07-b70f-b749a0443b01.png)

FTC Teams can advance through scoring or through [awards](../../wwroboftc/outreach/awards).

### What to Bring
On the day before competition, make sure that you have a fully charged driver hub and battery. We will transport your teams storage box, so make sure that you've loaded it with everything you need. 

### What to Expect
On the day of competition, there will be lots of things to pay attention to. First, make sure your team knows exactly when they are competing. You also might want to download [the orange alliance] app to view live rankings and schedules. 
Before the competition you should also do a quick check to make sure your robot complies with the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/robot-inspection-checklist.pdf" target="_blank">robot inspection checklist</a>.
