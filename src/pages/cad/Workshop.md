#  Cad Workshop
#### Description: Over the first two weeks, you individually will be designing a robot from a previous FTC game called Rover Ruckus. Each step is listed below on what each assembly should including the drivetrain and main mechanism

 <h5> * After watching the video try to brainstorm ideas on how to score and traverse the field most efficiently. Once completed write it down and move on to Step 1. </54>

<br></br>

## Step  1  : Chassis/Drivetrain
 1. Defer back to the Chassis/Drivetrain lesson in Unit 1 to refresh on the topic 
 2. Next think of a drivetrain best suited for this challenge

 3. Next reference Unit 3 for the Onshape tutorial if needed and begin designing the chassis. If you require help or assitance please let a Consultant know.

 4. The entire process should take about a week to design a full chassis. After you are done let a Consultant know and move on to Step 2.

## Step 2: Main mechanism and Aesthetics:
 1. Reference your brainstorming and Unit 1 to pick a mechanism that is best suited for this challenge just like the drivetrain.
 2. After you pick one use Onshape to design it 

 3. Merge both the drivetrain and the mechanism  using a sturdy mount of your own design

 4. After your robot is completed let a consultant know. You are free to to customize it further if you want by coloring and improving it.
