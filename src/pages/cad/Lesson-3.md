## Inserting Parts and Assemblies
  To access the same parts we have in the ftc closet, we have the FTC Parts List. This section will explain how to insert parts from that folder or from any of your other documents.  

  To insert a part, first click the "Insert" button at the top left of the screen.

  The "Inserting Parts and Assemblies" window starts on the "Current Document" tab by default, so if you are only trying to import a part or assembly from the document you are currently on, you can skip to [here](### Inserting the Part). If you are trying to insert a part or assembly from the FTC Parts List, go to the "Other Documents" tab.

### Inserting the Part
  Once you have found the part you want to insert, click on it and move your cursor onto your assembly. A yellow preview of the item will follow your cursor around, and you left click to insert it.

  When you have inserted the part, hit the check mark to confirm the insertion. Clicking the X or hitting the Esc key will result in the insertion being canceled, though a popup will give you 30 seconds to restore the insertion.
