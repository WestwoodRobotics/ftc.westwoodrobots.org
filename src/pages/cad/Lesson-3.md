## Inserting Parts and Assemblies
  To access the same parts we have in the ftc closet, we have the FTC Parts List. This section will explain how to insert parts from that folder or from any of your other documents.  

  To insert a part, first click the "Insert" button at the top left of the screen. Alternately, you can press the "s" key and click the top left image on the panel that pops up.

  The "Inserting Parts and Assemblies" window starts on the "Current Document" tab by default, so if you are only trying to import a part or assembly from the document you are currently on, you can skip to [Inserting the Part](#inserting-the-part). Otherwise, if you are trying to insert a part or assembly from the FTC Parts List, go to the "Other Documents" tab.

 From the Other Documents tab, navigate to "FTC Robotics Parts Users", which has most of the ftc parts supplied by major FTC part vendors such as goBILDA and REV Robotics.

From here, you can navigate through these folders to find the part you want to insert. I am going to show the way to insert a 5203 Series Yellow Jacket Planetary Gear Motor &mdash; a motor often used in our robot designs &mdash; and the exact path will be different for inserting different parts.

### Inserting the Part
  Once you have found the part you want to insert, click on it and move your cursor onto your assembly. A yellow preview of the item will appear on your cursor which can be inserted with a left click. When you have inserted the part, hit the check mark to confirm the insertion. Clicking the X or hitting the Esc key will result in the insertion being canceled, though a popup will give you 30 seconds to restore the insertion so it's no biggie.

## Mates/Constraints
Mates are geometric constraints that define an object's position and the ways it can move in relation to faces, edges, or vertices.

### Fasten Mate
Fasten Mates are the simplest mates, rigidly connecting 2 faces like glue. To use a fasten mate, click on 

### Revolute Mate
Mate but spinny.
