## Inserting Parts
To access the same parts we have in the ftc closet, we have the FTC Parts List. This section will explain how to insert parts from that folder or any of your other documents.
To begin, start :)

## Mates/Constraints
### Fasten Mate
Mate but basic.

### Revolute Mate
Mate but spinny.
