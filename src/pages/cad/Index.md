## Subteam Summary:
CAD is the design and modelling branch of FTC. On the CAD subteam you will work closely with hardware to design the robot and determine effective manufacturing strategies. You will also work closely with programming to ensure that the robot is designed to be easily programmed. CADers spend most of their time using [OnShape] to design 3d models of the robot. This year, CAD members will also be active in hardware and vice versa.
