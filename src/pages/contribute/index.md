## How to Contribute to this Website
Contributing to this site is a great opportunity to aid Westwood Robotics in its mission as well as gain experience through teaching.

If you want to contribute, just follow these steps. (no programming experience required!)
<!--- TODO: Once the Github tutorial is complete, just change the first step to a link to the Github page --->
### Step 1: Become a Member
Make sure that you are a member of the Westwood Robotics Github organization. 

#### How to check if you are already a member:
On the [Westwood Robotics Organization Github Page](https://github.com/WestwoodRobotics), click on the people section ![](wwroboftc/src/pages/contribute/2022-08-07-17-12-53.png) or follow this [link](https://github.com/orgs/WestwoodRobotics/people).
> if you don't have a github account already, [create one](https://github.com/signup)

#### If you are not already a member:
Fill out this [google form](https://forms.gle/suwh3sPg8qEHCRez5) (must be logged into RRISD email to do so) and we will add you to the organization as soon as possible.

### Step 2: Accessing your page
I'll start this step with instructions on how to access a page for editing, then end with how to create one.

#### Open the project in Github
On the [Westwood Robotics Page](https://github.com/WestwoodRobotics) in Github, navigate to the repositories tab and open the repository titled ```wwroboftc```.

> if you have a preferred IDE, feel free to follow the next few steps on that after [cloning the project](/wwroboftc/programming/GitHub) to your computer.

Click on the ```pages``` folder.

Inside of the pages folder navigate to whichever folder contains the page that you would like to edit.

> NOTE: the pages titled ```index.md``` are in reality called whatever folder name which they are in. For example, index.md inside of the programming folder is the page westwoodrobotics.github.io/wwroboftc/programming.

Once you've found the file you want to edit, open it up. 

#### Edit the md file
You can edit the pages using **Markdown**. If you do not know what markdown is, learn about it [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) (its just for formatting).

If you want to embed google slides, google docs, or need any help with editing the md file, contact [Reet (Discord: DrIronfist#2548)](https://discord.com/users/726608190023663666), [Jadon (Discord: jadopotato#4717)](https://discord.com/users/542163475380830208), or [Abraham (Discord: Cesar_Oso#7229)](https://discord.com/users/770472531324698624).

#### Creating a New Page
If you want to add something to the website that wouldn't fit in any of the already present pages, you can create a new page.
