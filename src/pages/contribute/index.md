## How to Contribute to this Website
Contributing to this site is a great opportunity to aid Westwood Robotics in its mission as well as gain experience through teaching.

If you want to contribute, just follow these steps. (no programming experience required!)
<!--- TODO: Once the Github tutorial is complete, just change the first step to a link to the Github page --->
### Step 1: Become a Member
Make sure that you are a member of the Westwood Robotics Github organization. 

#### How to check if you are already a member:
On the [Westwood Robotics Organization Github Page](https://github.com/WestwoodRobotics), click on the people section ![](./2022-08-07-17-12-53.png) or follow this [link](https://github.com/orgs/WestwoodRobotics/people).
> if you don't have a github account already, [create one](https://github.com/signup)

#### If you are not already a member:
Fill out this [google form](https://forms.gle/suwh3sPg8qEHCRez5) (must be logged into RRISD email to do so) and we will add you to the organization as soon as possible.

### Step 2: Accessing your page
I'll start this step with instructions on how to access a page for editing, then end with how to create one.

#### Open the project in Github
On the [Westwood Robotics Page](https://github.com/WestwoodRobotics) in Github, navigate to the repositories tab and open the repository titled ```wwroboftc```.

> if you have a preferred IDE, feel free to follow the next few steps on that after [cloning the project](/wwroboftc/programming/GitHub) to your computer.

Click on the ```pages``` folder.
