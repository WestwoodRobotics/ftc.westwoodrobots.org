## FIRST DAY START HERE:

## Subteam Summary:
Programming is totally objectivveely without a doubt the bestest most coolest subteam because we get to make the robot do cool stuff. We use [Android Studio] and [Java] to program the robot. We also use [GitHub] to collaborate on code. Programmers work closely with hardware to ensure that the robot design is easy enough to program that there will be enough time to program. More often than not, the drive team of the robot is composed of programmers, since they are the ones who designed the controls and have the most experience of operating it. Programmers spend most of their time learning Java, writing code, and testing out their programs in real life to make sure that everything is running smoothly. Programmers are also enouraged to help with this website!
