## What is Android Studio
Android Studio is the primary IDE (integrated development environment)(where we write code) that we use in FTC. We use it mainly because programmers in FTC are essentially designing an Android app that will be run on the control hub (computer on the robot (is an android device)). While we recommend that each team has at least 2 individuals with a personal laptop that can run Android Studio, it is possible to use school desktops (although you won't be able to bring these to competitions are move them from Mr. Wilmots room). 


## Installation and Setup
If you ever need any help with installation or set-up, feel free to contact (contacts coming soon...).

### Steps Followed for Both Paths
In both scenarios, you will first have to have git installed on your computer and be added to the Westwood Robotics Github organization. For more on how to do these look [here](./Github).

### Installation On Personal Computer
If your installing Android Studio on your personal computer, head to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads" target="_blank">the Android Studio download page</a> and select the exe installer. The set-up wizard will walk you though all following steps. 

### Installation On School Computer [tentative]
*In the near future we might change these steps, removing the download step, only requiring the set up step*

Head to <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads" target="_blank">the Android Studio download page</a> and download the windows zip file option.

Once the download has completed, open file explorer and navigate to the downloads folder. Right click on the Android Studio zip file that just downloaded and click extract files. Press ok and wait for the extraction to complete. 

Once extracted, you should see a new folder in your downloads that had the same name as the zip file but is not zipped. Open that folder and open the ```bin``` folder within that folder. 

Locate the file inside of ```bin``` that is called ```studio64``` which should be an exe file that has an Android logo as its icon. Right click this file and select the create shortcut option. You will now see a new file created right next to the old ```studio64``` that has a small arrow in the corner of its logo. Drag this file from the file explorer onto your deskto (windows background). 

Now you can close file explorer.

Double click the shortcut that you created on your desktop to open android studio. Upon opening for the first time, a list of setup options will appear. In most cases, you can leave all of this at their defualt settings. 

Once all of the set-up has been complete, you should see a screen that looks like this:
