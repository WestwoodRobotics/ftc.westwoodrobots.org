### Welcome to your first programming lesson
## Setting up android studios
### Turn on android studios

Lets start setting up your workspace. Android studios should already be installed, so boot it up. \
After you have done so, we are ready to start.

### Set Up Git(Version Control)
First, download git [Here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.41.0.windows.3/PortableGit-2.41.0.3-64-bit.7z.exe). \
\
Run the executable after downloading, and go through the steps to download. Remember to put the downloaded file somewhere you can find, as this will be necessary later.

### Set-up Roadrunner Quickstart
Next, you will have to import a FTC quickstart project. \
Why do we import a project? A empty project means that it isnt set up to communicate with the hardware, and there will not be a library, for you to use, when coding.
\
We will use Git, a version control system, to backup our project and code. \
Select the **`Get From VCS`** option.

\
Select **`Configure`**. \
