## Types of Drivetrains
There are 2 main types of drivetrains: tank drive and mecanum drive. In lesson 3, you'll learn about how each drivetrain works and how to code them.


## Tank Drive
## Tank Drive Theoretically
Tank drive is the simpler and more straightforward drivetrain. In tank drive, each side of the robot is controlled individually. In order for the robot to move forward or backwards, all 4 wheels move forward and backwards. For the robot to turn, one side has to move forward and the other side has to move backward.
