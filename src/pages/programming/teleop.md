## Mecanum Drive
### Wheels
Mecanum drive is a type of drive that uses wheels that have rollers, which are attatched to the wheel typically at a 45 degree angle. Below is an example of a really cool looking mecanum wheel that I wish would be used in Westwood Robotics.

### Movement
Because of how the rollers are attatched to the wheel, when it spins it generates a propelling force perpendicular to the roller axle. We can use this to allow the robot to move in any direction without changing its orientation. 
Below is a diagram of the ways to move a robot based on the directions the wheels are spinning:
