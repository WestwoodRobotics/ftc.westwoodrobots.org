## Parts
- Through Bore Bearing - Short (2)
- Shaft Collar (2)
- 5mm X 75mm Hex Shaft
- 10 tooth #25 Sprocket
- 3mm spacer 

## Goals
Create a shaft assembly for experience and to create a basic understanding of shaft assemblies.
## [Steps for assembly (pg 3-12)](https://www.revrobotics.com/content/docs/2021-2022%20Starter%20Bot-BG.pdf)

## What is this used for?
This is a key part of the drivetrain of a robot, specifically the wheels and how theyâ€™re powered by motors. Every drivetrain will have some variation of this.

## Follow Up
Come up with your own design, potentially using gears or chains.
